## Paprback

Paprback is a virtual bookshelf to manage all your readings. You can search for any book in the world and start building a shelf that you can showcase to the world.

You can visit the production app and start building your shelf at [alpha.paprback.co](https://alpha.paprback.co)

### Installation

Clone this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine. 

```jsx
$ git clone
$ cd paprback
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Once you've started the development server, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

I've included the env variables in the `.env` file, they're just public endpoints anyways.  

## Contributing

There's a number of things that can be worked on! If you find any bugs, or any features you think you can add, feel free to do so.

## Reflection

Iâ€™ve started countless projects that I never finished, so I wanted to commit to building something I could be passionate about and see an attainable end goal.
I gathered my friends PJ, a backend developer and Stephen, a talented designer and we got to work by deciding on what the DB Schema should like, the user stories + flow, and how do we differentiate from Goodreads. This was all documented on our Notion workspace. 

###### A little on the why Paprback was the idea
Anyone that has used Goodreads can tell you itâ€™s a pain, and thereâ€™s not much on the internet for avid readers. Thereâ€™s a big opportunity for designing communities for authors + readers to connect, as well as encouraging book discovery. 

###### Challenges
- I had no experience of building a backend, and it was initially difficult for me to communicate the goals with PJ
- My React knowledge was extremely limited, and it meant learning + building at the same time 
- We were essentially building from scratch with no guidance from experienced creators
- It wasnâ€™t until late we realized that our backend isnâ€™t scalable, we were too dependant on the Google Books API and were being rate limited
- Book donâ€™t have any standardized IDâ€™s, even ISBNs are inconsistent and APIs become super complex 

I made countless mistakes, but also learned a lot. Though I did want to give up, I stuck to my goal and pushed through to ensure the project was functional to a minimum. As a sole front-end developer with limited guidance, itâ€™s difficult to continue with it. I figured Iâ€™d move onto a couple other projects Iâ€™d like to built with the newfound knowledge, and continue learning. 

Overall, Iâ€™m glad I finally completed a project and learned so much in a short time. Iâ€™m excited to keep building. Here's a quick list of the React concepts I learned through this project.

- Functional + Class Components, HOCs
- Props vs State
- Conditional Rendering
- Hooks + Custom Hooks
- Context
- Error Boundaries
- Compound Components
- State Management, Routing, Styling, so much more.. 
- I did not learn Testing yet

## Built With

As I was learning React, other than using the boilerplate `create-react-app` , I did everything from scratch to truly learn what's happening behind the scenes and how to correctly design a full-stack project. As I progressed and hit roadblocks, I rebuilt the project a couple times and then finally settled on my favourite resources to build react projects. I've listed them below. 

- [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/)
    - Next JS is absolutely amazing. It made things extremely simple and everything just worked âœ¨. I'd like to try it out with Supabase in the near future, or directly connected to MongoDB. It's undoubtedly the best developer experience you can ask for.
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
    - Originally, I used `theme-ui` but I had to build a number of components myself and wanted something simpler for the time being. Chakra UI 1.0 was a much better experience with a great community. There's a number of components, animations and features built in, and provides full flexibility for you to own the styling.
- [SWR by Vercel](https://swr.vercel.app/)
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
    - At first, I built most form validation features myself to learn â€“ but wow, I did not know how complex it is. To avoid redundancies, I enjoyed using `react-hook-form` as a library.

The backend was built in Ruby by my friend PJ which you can checkout here ðŸ‘‰ [Paprback Backend](https://github.com/poujacques/bookclub-backend).

## Resources

Learning how to code can be overwhelming! Everyone has different styles of learning and diffrent things that click with them. Personally, I learn best through videos, examples and code alongs. I've shared some of the resources I used below. I also went on numerous random blogs for random issues, and asked questions within a number of Discord groups. 

*Courses*

- [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)
    - You get to code-along within an IDE / Video style format, it's really neat and Bob Ziroll is a great teacher.
- [React 2025](https://react2025.com/)
    - Huge vouch for this. Lee Robinson is absolutely amazing and super helpful. His way of teaching really stuck with me and it helped me understand concepts that no other course was able to.
- [React Security Fundamentals](https://reactsecurity.io/)
- [React Hooks by Codevolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF2lQ_gZeA8&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwisvxhZ135pogtX7_Oe3Q3A&ab_channel=Codevolution)
